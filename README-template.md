## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I refreshed my knowledge on tables. I want to improve in the usage of tables and also understand how to align and add borders to it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Calories</td>
            <td>220kg</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

### Continued development
I want to continue learning about CSS Flexbox concepts to improve my knowledge and usage of the concepts.
